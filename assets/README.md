# Assets

This directory contains assets for the Email to Markdown application.

## System Tray Icon

The application uses a default generated icon, but you can provide custom icons:

- **icon.ico** - Windows icon (recommended: 32x32 or multi-resolution ICO)
- **icon.png** - Cross-platform icon (recommended: 32x32 PNG with transparency)

Place your custom icon file here and the application will use it automatically.

### Icon Requirements

- Size: 32x32 pixels (minimum)
- Format: ICO (Windows) or PNG (cross-platform)
- Transparency: Supported
